# Exercise: Word Frequency Counter

This project is a console application designed to analyze the frequency of each word in a user-provided sentence. It ignores case differences to ensure that words are counted correctly irrespective of how they are capitalized.

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to:
- Enhance your skills in string manipulation and frequency analysis using C#.
- Practice developing console applications that interact with users.

## Requirements

- **.NET SDK**: Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine to compile and run the application.
- **IDE**: Any integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C# (e.g., Visual Studio, VSCode with C# extension).

## Features

- **User Input**: The application prompts the user to enter a sentence.
- **Case Insensitivity**: The application treats words with different cases as the same word (e.g., "The" and "the" are considered the same).
- **Frequency Display**: After processing, it displays the frequency of each word present in the sentence.

## Example

```plaintext
Please enter a sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barked.
