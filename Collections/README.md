# C# Collections Deep Dive

Welcome to the C# Collections Deep Dive repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and mastering the use of various generic collections in C#. Here you'll find detailed examples and explanations for using `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `HashSet<T>`, `Queue<T>`, and `Stack<T>`. Each collection type is explored in terms of its structure, operations, and practical applications.

## Collections Overview

### 1. `List<T>`
- **Dynamic Sizing:** Learn how Lists automatically resize and accommodate data as items are added or removed.
- **Operations:** Adding, removing, and searching items within the List.
- **Usage:** Perfect for scenarios where the collection size changes dynamically and frequent access to elements by index is needed.

### 2. `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`
- **Key-Value Pairs:** Understand the efficient storage and retrieval of data through unique keys.
- **Usage:** Best for scenarios requiring quick lookup capabilities and association of pairs like usernames to user details.

### 3. `HashSet<T>`
- **Set Operations:** Focus on storing unique items and utilizing operations like unions and intersections.
- **Usage:** Ideal for ensuring no duplicates are present and for performing mathematical set operations.

### 4. `Queue<T>`
- **Sequential Access (FIFO):** Explore the first-in-first-out approach to managing items.
- **Usage:** Useful in sequential processing tasks such as job scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.

### 5. `Stack<T>`
- **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO):** Dive into the last-in-first-out methodology for handling collections.
- **Usage:** Essential for applications like undo mechanisms, syntax parsing, and depth-first search operations.
